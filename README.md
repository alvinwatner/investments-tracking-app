# Summary


In this technical test, I demonstrated a broad landscape of frontend skills, covering web, mobile, Android, and iOS applications. Additionally, I designed the desktop version UI to showcase my UI/UX designing skills. I believe my expertise can significantly contribute to Packform, allowing the company to focus more on business aspects.

## Packform Technical Test (Web, Mobile, Android, & iOS)

## Web and Mobile

The web and mobile versions were built using the popular React.JS framework, Next.JS. You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/alvinwatner/investments-tracking-app-nextjs).

## Android and iOS

The Android and iOS versions were built with Flutter, a widely-used cross-platform framework. You can find the Android `apk` at the "Additional Link" section. In this repository, I showcased my Flutter technical skills with scalability and maintainability in mind. Key aspects include:

1. The implementation of Clean Architecture as proposed by Robert C. Martin.
2. The ability to adjust to different technical environments.
3. Knowledge of clean coding principles.
4. The usage of Bloc for state management.
5. Best practices in UI/UX implementation, including configuring the color scheme and text theme, and utilizing a variety of Flutter widgets such as Chips, ChoiceChips, TabBars, and the newest widget, Gap.
