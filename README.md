# Summary


In this technical test, I demonstrated a broad landscape of frontend skills ranging from web-desktop, mobile to Android & iOS mobile applications. I believe I would be a valuable asset to Packform, allowing the company to focus more on business aspects.

## Packform Technical Test (Flutter)

In this particular repository, I showcased my Flutter technical skills with scalability and maintainability in mind, highlighting the following aspects:

1. The implementation of Clean Architecture as proposed by Robert C. Martin.
2. The ability to adjust to different technical environments.
3. Knowledge of clean coding principles.
4. The usage of Bloc for state management.
5. Best practices in UI/UX implementation, including configuring the color scheme and text theme, and utilizing a variety of Flutter widgets such as Chips, ChoiceChips, TabBars, and the newest widget, Gap.
